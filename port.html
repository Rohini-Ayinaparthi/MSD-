        <p>
            Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a keen interest in Software development, graphic design, data analysis, etc.  where I’ve acquired skills in programming, design, data analysis, etc. These experiences have fueled my curiosity and driven me to explore various projects and extracurricular activities that align with my career goals.

        <p>
            In addition to my coursework, I’m actively involved in sports club , where I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with peers, participate in competitions, and contribute to my favourite sport chess. I’m constantly seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios, whether through internships, research, or personal projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            My current focus is on building a strong portfolio that showcases my skills and experiences. I’m eager to continue learning, growing, and contributing to the field of Computer Science as I prepare to transition from academia to the professional world.
